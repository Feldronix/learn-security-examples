- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Similar to the previous attack, there is no verification of the client's activity. 
In addition to this authentication, the secure version also logs all actions 
(and information such as IP) to track activity more effectively.

Audit policies that search for malicious patterns help to identify/analyze repudiation-related
attacks more effectively.
