Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Using unsanitized input as part of the Mongoose query leaves the program vulnerable to 
injection attacks where the attacker inputs a value that manipulates the query to expose
more data than intended. The secure version sanitizes the input by removing any special characters, 
preventing the query from revealing sensitive data.

Information disclosure violates Confidentiality due to the additional data revealed via unsanitized queries.

Parameterizing the data prevents information disclosure by ensuring that malicious input does not affect the
query due to being sent for execution seperately.
