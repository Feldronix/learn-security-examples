- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

The vulnerability is that attackers can provide input that crashes the server. 
By continously sending these malicious requests, access to the server is blocked.
The secure version prevents this attack by handling cases that would crash program,
 allowing it to continue servicing clients.

 Setting up services that limit the rate at which a client can send requests also helps to combat DOS attacks
 though doesn't completely nullify the threat (especially DDOS attacks).
