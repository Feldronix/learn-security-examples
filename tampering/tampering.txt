The vulnerability in this program is that the unsanitized input for the user's name
is sent as part of the HTML response. As such, the input can contain an HTML script component
that manipulates the page that the user receives.

This means that Tampering violates the Availability property of CIA via unsanitized inputs
affecting the web page in a way that prevents the user from interacting with the desired content.
