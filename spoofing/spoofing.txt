Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The cookie used to manage a user's session is vulnerable to being accessed programatically 
and used to forge requests from other domains. By setting up the session so that the cookie
does not appear in document.cookie, it is no longer readable by the attacker. By only accepting
a cookie if it comes from the same domain, it prevents attackers from sending malicous requests
from external domains.

Spoofing violates Confidentiality by allowing attackers to access a session that belongs to another user.

Bonus: The secret key that is used to sign the session cookie is hard-coded into the program which
allows attackers to hijack a session by guessing the session id. Making it accessible via an alternative
(input or environment variable) prevents this attack from taking place
