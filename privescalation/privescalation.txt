The insecure script does not have a way to validate whether the client
is actually the user they claim to be, allowing an attacker to act as an 
admin by guessing the correct ID. By using a session to track clients, the secure
version allows the client to be authenticated .

Since the session is pivotal to authentication, securing the session itself via hiding
cookies (from being read programatically and only sent to the same domain) secures it further.
Adding more authentication beyond the session secures the script further (such as via 2FA) to
prevent privilege escalation even when session is hijacked.
